# Additionally, we have classes, which serve as the blueprint for objects, and
# objects are instances built from these classes.

# simple example of person class and two object from it:

# Person class
# attribute -> (name and age)
# method -> (say_hi and run)

# Person object 1
# Mahdi,21

# Person object 2
# AliReza,20
