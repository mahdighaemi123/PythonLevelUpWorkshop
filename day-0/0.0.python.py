# High-level programming language:
# A high-level programming language refers to a programming language
# with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.
# This means that it doesn’t deal with the low-level operations of the computer’s architecture,
# making it easier to read, write, and maintain. In simple terms, it allows developers to write programs
# in a way that’s close to human language and makes it more accessible for them to work with.

# Easy to use and Learn:
# It’s really easy to learn compare to other languges becase its really close to english languge
# It’s really easy to use and you can coding much faster and build app in shourt amount of time

# Open source:
# you can access it source for free
# you can download, read it, or even change it.

# Big community:
# Many companies and researchers use it, so it has a big community.
# and for that there are lots of ready-to-use code libraries available.
